# Monarch Pretty Samples

Monarch sample code and stories using pretty user interfaces. This project contains 3 user interfaces: booking, design course, and onboarding.

The [Monarch website](https://monarchapp.io/) showcases the booking user interface.

The UIs in this project are based on
[Best-Flutter-UI-Templates](https://github.com/mitesh77/Best-Flutter-UI-Templates).
